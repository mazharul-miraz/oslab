10. Write a C program to solve the following problem: Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000
cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143,
and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO
order is:

86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130

Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm
moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the FCFS disk-scheduling algorithms ?
