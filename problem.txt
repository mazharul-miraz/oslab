1. Write a C program to solve the following problem: Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order, is: 86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130â€¦

Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the FCFS disk-scheduling algorithms.


2. Design a scheduling program to implements a Queue with two levels:
                    Level 1 : Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling
                    Level 2: Round Robin Scheduling
For a Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling (Queue1), the Priority 0 is highest priority. If one process P1 is scheduled and running, another process P2 with higher priority comes. The New process (high  priority) process P2 preempts currently running process P1 and process P1 will go to second level qu. Tm for which process will strictly execute must be considered in the multiples of 2. All the processes in second level queue will complete their execution according to round robin scheduling.

Consider:
 1. Queue 2 will be processed after Queue 1 becomes empty.
2. Priority of Queue 2 has lower priority than in Queue 1.
